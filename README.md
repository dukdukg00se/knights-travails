# Knights Travails

## Overview

A program that shows the most efficient route for a knight piece to get from a start position to an end position.

## Usage

Choose your own start and end positions by clicking "Pick Start" or "Pick End" buttons and selecting a square on the board. Alternatively, log random knight positions by selecting the "Random Start" or "Random End" options.

Once a start and end square is highlighted, visualize the most efficient knight path by selecting the "Travail" button.
